# End-to-End Customer Trend Analysis

### Purpose / Business Problem

The purpose of this analysis is to assist a retail organization to identify consumer trends across demographics, product categories and sales channels. Leadership and stakeholders would also like to better understand how to improve customer satisfaction and long-term loyalty. The following questions have been asked of this analysis:

* What is the total revenue generated by male vs. female customers?
* Which customers used a discount but still spent more than the average purchase
amount?
* Which are the top 5 products with the highest average review rating?
* Compare the average Purchase Amounts between Standard and Express Shipping.
* Do subscribed customers spend more? Compare average spend and total revenue between
subscribers and non-subscribers.
* Which 5 products have the highest percentage of purchases with discounts applied?
* Segment customers into New, Returning, and Loyal based on their total number of
previous purchases, and show the count of each segment.
* What are the top 3 most purchased products within each category?
* Are customers who are repeat buyers (more than 5 previous purchases) also likely to
subscribe?
* What is the revenue contribution of each age group?
